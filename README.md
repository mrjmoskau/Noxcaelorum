# Noxcaelorum
An old computer DM program

## Many years ago...
There was a French gaming magazine called Jeux & Strat&eacute;gies. The magazine was strongly focused on physical games: chess, checkers, go, card games of all kinds, and some of the first RPG games that were coming to market at the time in Europe.

Did I mention this was a "French from France" magazine?

Well, one of the other main foci of the magazine was the nascent computer game market. The magazine was a window (no put intended) to a whole new market of possibilities that came with the advent of personal computers: The Commodore 64, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Commodore Amiga, Tandy PC, etc. Many of the computers that you could buy in Europe at the time. Not only that, but due to the high price of dial-up access at the time, it (along with many other European magazines) would provide computer programs that you could code yourself on your own personal computer.

Noxcaelorum was one of those programs.

## Today-ish...
I have honestly meant to figure out how to implement the game many different ways over many different years. I have also NEVER actually played it through using the actual article that described it, which provided the programs for personal computers AND programmable calculators, along with a a series of tables and directions on how to "play" the game using a ten-by-ten grid, a pencil and an eraser. Call me lazy...

And so I've finally decided to REALLY put some effort into this game once and for all, and to see if I can make something of it that could be of interest to someone out there in the big wild web, whether they speak English, French or Other, and have an interest in strange little video game / RPG hybrids that came out of nowhere way back in 1984!

## Current Files
The files on offer as of this writing (2022-08-14 or so) are as follows:

* pseudo - my attempt at breaking down the workflow of the game from the original Noxcaelorum article;
* noxcaelorum-og.bas - the actual code from the original game printed with the article... this would most likely run on a Commodore 64 or BBC Micro (although the ZX Spectrum is NOT supported); and
* noxcaelorum.bas - a version of the program that will actually run / compile using the FreeBasic environment / compiler. This code has been tweaked to allow the program to run, and I have done so successfully on a Raspberry Pi using FreeBasic 1.09.0, with certain judicious edits.

It's important to note that using the program at this time still requires the use of a sheet of graph or grid paper, as well as a pen or pencil and an eraser. My intention is to allow the game to track player stats, to keep track of terrain / locations based on the seed and level variables (each game is different, after all), all while still allowing for player input rather than having the game play itself.

Oh, and I also intend to use this as a project for learning Python, so we'll see how well that goes.
