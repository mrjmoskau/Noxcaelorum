# Noxcaelorum
An old computer DM program

Many years ago...
There was a French gaming magazine called Jeux & Strat&eacute;gies. The magazine was strongly focused on physical games: chess, checkers, go, card games of all kinds, and some of the first RPG games that were coming to market at the time in Europe.

Did I mention this was a "French from France" magazine?

Well, one of the other main foci of the magazine was the nascent computer game market. The magazine was a window (no put intended) to a whole new market of possibilities that came with the advent of personal computers: The Commodore 64, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum, Commodore Amiga, Tandy PC, etc. Many of the computers that you could buy in Europe at the time. Not only that, but due to the high price of dial-up access at the time, it (along with many other European magazines) would provide computer programs that you could code yourself on your own personal computer.

Noxcaelorum was one of those programs.
